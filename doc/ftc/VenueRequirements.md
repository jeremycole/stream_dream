# Venue Requirements

The requirements from the venue for a good event live stream and usable video recordings are:

* Access to the venue during pre-event setup
  - Typical setup for FTC takes a couple of hours.
* About half of a table or so of space, ideally up front with the scorekeeper/refs, projectors, etc.
* A single standard 120V power outlet available within about 10 feet of the table.
* A wired or WiFi internet connection with decent speeds (typically a minimum of ~8 Mbit upload speed for 1080p video).
  - Most school internet connections should work fine, however blocking rules/firewalls may cause problems.
* Permission to set up equipment in the competition area and (nicely!) run a few wires around to connect things:
  - A tall (13 ft) tripod and camera at the edge of each competition field.
  - A camera somewhere centrally up front for opening ceremonies and awards.
  - A camera somewhere behind, up high if possible, facing the audience.
  - A microphone to record room/ambient audio of the audience.
* The announcers/emcees *must* use the provided wireless microphones (two handheld Shure SM58).
* The game sounds must be patched into the provided audio mixer.
  - This is typically done using a 3.5mm TRS audio cable connected to the computer running the main timing/score display projector.
* The output of the audio mixer needs to be patched into the venue's (or event provided) audio/PA system. This is typically done with a wired connection to an available XLR or 1/4-inch "mic" or "line in" port.
* The Stream Dream Rig needs to be connected to the FTC "scorekeeper" software (as a "display") to get live scoring overlays for the stream and videos.
  - This is typically done using a secondary WiFi adapter in the rig, but can also be done using the primary WiFi (if everything is using the same WiFi connection) or wired Ethernet.

Prior to the event, it's helpful to do some advertising on whatever social media accounts exist for the organizations related to the event, and then make some announcements at the venue, and additionally put up some signs around the venue, so that people can find the live stream and send it to their friends and family.
