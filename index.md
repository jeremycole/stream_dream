# Stream Dream

Live streaming and match video production for FIRST Tech Challenge robotics competitions.

Check out the [Hardware](doc/Hardware.md) and [Software](doc/Software.md] for the Stream Dream.

## Background

The FIRST Tech Challenge program organizes robotics competitions worldwide with anywhere from a few to several dozen teams participating. These are typically organized by a few local (and very dedicated) volunteers. In some regions, teams may be spread out across a large geographical area (hundreds of miles/km). Not all teams may be able to attend all events, and parents or other interested parties may not be able to attend competitions. For this reason, there is often interest in being able to spectate on competitions remotely. Additionally, teams have an interest in having good quality video of their matches made available for review and training purposes.

We would like to be able to live stream all competitions in Northern Nevada and Southern Nevada regions

## Requirements, nice-to-haves, and non-goals

### Requirements

* Ease of setup and teardown – we have a limited amount of setup time, and every venue offers new challenges.
* Wired cameras – since FTC robots use WiFi, avoid heavy use of WiFi frequencies, especially high-bandwidth streams from multiple cameras.
* Video of each competition field – with a reasonable angle for viewing the competition.
* Audio of the announcer – it's very hard to follow the matches from video alone.

### Nice to have

* High entertainment value – robotics events span multiple hours, so the more entertaining and engaging to watch, the better.
* High fidelity for filler content – for example for playing explanatory videos on the stream.
* Video of the venue other than the fields – to allow the viewers to feel more involved and engaged, it is nice to have many angles showing what's going on.
* Audio of the attendees – it can be very nice, and more fun, to hear the cheering/clapping, oohs and ahhs, etc.

### Non-goals

* Perfect video.
* Video with extremely high resolution – typically the venues where events are held have limited Internet bandwidth anyway, so it is not necessary or useful to have e.g. 4K streaming capability.
